# Problem Statement
The organ donation system faces a critical challenge marked by a severe shortage of available organs for transplantation. Despite advancements in medical technology and an increasing demand for life-saving organ transplants, the supply of donated organs has not kept pace. This shortage leads to prolonged waiting times, increased patient mortality rates, and a growing sense of despair among individuals awaiting life-saving transplants.
# Project Description
Organ donation is a medical procedure in which an individual voluntarily donates their organs or tissues, either during their lifetime or after death, for transplantation into another person. The primary purpose of organ donation is to save lives or improve the quality of life for individuals suffering from organ failure or dysfunction. Organs and tissues that can be donated include the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys, pancreas, intestines, corneas, skin, bone, and bone marrow.
